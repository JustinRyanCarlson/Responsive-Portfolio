							My name is Justin Carlson and I am a 25 year old aspiring web developer. I grew up in a rural Midwestern town called Manito in the central part of Illinois. As a child I was always interested in computers and how they worked. I can recall the first computer my parents bought for the family, and I was amazed at the interactions you could have with the world through a small box sitting in your living room. Ever since then I have been trying to cultivate my knowledge in the world of computers.

							In college I studied chemistry with an emphasis on biochemistry and the role chemical compounds in pharmaceuticals. Due to the rigorous curriculum, I was unable to study much computer science until I was given the opportunity to take a Java programming course my senior year. That course was a turning point for me as I felt like development was something I could do and not just magic when something is clicked on a webpage. I completed my degree, but the thought of becoming a developer has been in my mind ever since. I'm currently working toward my goals at Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp and hope with enough hard work and determination the jump to Jr Web Developer will be successful.
